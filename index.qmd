# TheKangarooFactory Wiki

Welcome to this Wiki.

As most of us do, I tend to keep tons of notes about how to do this or that in a not so organized folder.

The goal of this wiki is to share short how-to articles as well as longer tutorials in an organized environment providing automated features to navigate easily.

-   Folder structure

-   Search across articles

Longer articles will be linked to dedicated repositories inside my GitHub

-   GitHub: <https://github.com/thekangaroofactory>

-   Specific [R](https://github.com/thekangaroofactory?tab=repositories&q=template-r&type=&language=&sort=) templates

-   Specific [Python](https://github.com/thekangaroofactory?tab=repositories&q=template-python&type=&language=&sort=) templates
